             Neurocognitive disorders are characterized by acquired deficits in cognitive function.1﻿ These disorders do not include those in which impaired cognition was present at birth or early in life. Types of cognitive disorders include:
             <h3>Delirium</h3>
             Delirium is also known as acute confusional state. This disorder develops over a short period of time—usually a few hours or a few days—and is characterized by disturbances in attention and awareness
             <h3>Neurocognitive Disorders</h3>
             Major and mild neurocognitive disorders have the primary feature of acquired cognitive decline in one or more areas including memory, attention, language, learning, and perception. These cognitive disorders can be due to medical conditions including Alzheimer's disease, HIV infection, Parkinson's disease, substance/medication use, vascular disease, and others.
