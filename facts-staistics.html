        <h2 style="background-color: cornflowerblue;">Psychological Issues in India - statistics</h2>
        
        <p>
            It is no surprise that the state of mental health of a country, correlates positively with its economic growth. Projections show that India will suffer massive economic losses owing to mental health conditions. As of 2015, on a global level, over 322.48 million people worldwide suffer from some form of depressive disorder and as of 2017, more than 14 percent of the total population in India suffer from variations of mental disorders. The majority of this share includes older adult females in India.
            <h3>Why calculate burden of disease?</h3>
            The burden of a disease or condition is calculated by adding together, the number of years of life a person loses due to disease or premature death, and the number of years of life lived with the disability. The sum of this is known as disability adjusted life year or DALY. While neuropsychiatric conditions are the leading causes of morbidity in many regions of the world today, they do not account for a significant number of deaths. In this context, such disorders are not regarded as having a major impact on the health of population. However, when the DALYs of such psychiatric disorders are calculated, it is able to effectively quantify, to an extent, not only the quality of a person’s life living with a mental disorder, but more, the implications it has in terms of contribution towards the society and economy. In India, the contribution of mental illnesses to total disease burden doubled between 1990 and 2017. Some of these include severe disorders such as autism, bipolar disorders, and schizophrenia. However, depression followed by anxiety disorders were found to be the most prevalent among the female adult population.
            <h3>What makes Indians susceptible?</h3>
            In India, every seventh person suffers from some form of mental disorder. The epidemiology of mental disorders, specifically, depression on a global scale, has been vastly studied. Today, it is regarded as the leading contributor to disease burden and morbidity worldwide, that may even result in suicide if left untreated. Risk factors, relative to developing depressive and anxiety disorders, include bullying victimization, childhood sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, and lead exposure as an environmental risk factor which can lead to idiopathic developmental intellectual disability.
            <h3>Mental health and COVID-19</h3>
            The implications of living in quarantine, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in India was not only a stress trigger but also had negative psychological effects on the population. Indians learnt to adapt to the new normal which affected every dimension of their lifestyle, i.e. levels of physical activity, sleep cycles, nutrition, and their social lives. In an attempt to cope with this paradigm shift, long bouts of stress caused by enforced isolation, financial stress, job cuts, along with unhealthy lifestyles were the precursors for depression and anxiety. In addition, those already victim to these disorders, prior to the pandemic, found their conditions to be exacerbated, as a result of social isolation and neglect due to overworked healthcare systems.

        <h2 style="background-color: coral;">Psychological Issues in India - Facts</h2>
        <ul style="margin-left:30px;">
            <li>A report by the World Health Organisation (WHO) revealed that 7.5 per cent of the Indian population suffers from some form of mental disorder. Mental illnesses constitute one-sixth of all health-related disorders and India accounted for nearly 15% of the global mental, neurological and substance abuse disorder burden. The treatment gap, which is defined as the prevalence of mental illnesses and the proportion of patients that get treatment, is over 70 per cent. WHO also predicts that by 2020, roughly 20 per cent of India will suffer from mental illnesses. And to cater to this demographic, we have less than 4,000 mental health professionals</li>
            <li> When it comes to physical health, people are so conscious and aware these days. They know everything there is to know: what super-foods eat and what not to eat, what the latest diet fads are, what the most cutting-edge workouts to stay fit are, and how to monitor every aspect of their health with state-of-the-art fitness bands.
                 But when it comes to mental health, the awareness just isn’t there. Just like Mary Alice Do, so many people aren’t even aware that they may be suffering from a mental health concern. Educating people about mental wellbeing, however, is a battle in itself.</li>
            <li>In our country, the discovery of a mental illness is often followed by denial and hesitation to seek help. Despite its enormous social burden, mental health remains a taboo subject that is susceptible to age-old stigmas, prejudices and fears. Even though mental disorders can be cured or controlled, most people tend to sweep their issues under the carpet and suffer in silence. Not only do we need to actively foster awareness about mental health, we also need to create awareness about the absurdity of the stigmas attached to mental health, in order to eradicate them.</li>
            <li>It is important for everyone to get involved. Workshops and programs in schools, colleges, corporates and communities can help foster a movement for mental health. We must all learn to identify and red-flag signs of mental health concerns in ourselves and in others. A partnership between psychiatrists, psychiatric social workers, anthropologists, NGOs, and local volunteers could play an important role in fostering mental health awareness and making mental health services accessible to the masses.</li>
            <li>Supporting individuals to talk openly and without inhibitions about their mental health issues is the crucial first step. Family and friends helping the individuals seek professional help is the next one. At times, if we see red-flags of mental health issues in someone close to us, we must think of it as our responsibility to affect an intervention with the help of others.</li>
            <li>The internet and the social media have a huge role to play as well. They have the power to break taboos and alleviate stigma. Online apps and support groups can put those who are suffering in touch with those who can help or are facing similar concerns. Those who have recovered from mental illnesses are telling their stories via the social media to inspire others, across barriers of language, borders and cultures. A mental health campaign on the social media is the fastest way to reach out to people. And as our change-makers, our youth have to lead the way in changing mindsets.Being aware of emotions, thoughts and reactions helps maintain balance</li>
            <li>Just as charity begins at home, so does mental health awareness. There are several coping mechanisms that we can employ in our day-to-day to improve our own emotional intelligence and mental well-being exponentially.</li>
            <li>We must learn to balance our positive and negative feelings. It is impossible for an individual to not have any negative feelings at all. Being aware of our feelings, processing them and expressing them can allow us to balance the negative feelings with positive ones and instil a sense of optimism in ourselves. And if we feel we can’t overcome the negativity, then it is time to seek professional help.</li>
            <li>To periodically reevaluate our lives, see what has impacted us emotionally and intellectually, and to review our life’s journey objectively helps put things properly into perspective for us. It allows us to shed the mental baggage that we so often begin to unconsciously carry with us from time to time.
                It is also important for us to learn to take responsibility for our thoughts, emotions, behaviors and actions. All of us have shortcomings just as we have our plus points. All of us make mistakes from time to time; all of us develop invisible mental health concerns. To be aware of what we are thinking, how we are reacting and what we are doing keeps us balanced as personalities and allows us to make crucial changes in our lives. At times, it is also beneficial to seek constructive feedback about ourselves. It helps us become aware of how we are engaging with the world. As in the case of Barbara Lipska, it was only the intervention from family and friends that made her realise that she was suffering from a mental illness along with her cancer.</li>
